          <h3>Computer Networks</h3>
          <p>computer networks connect two or more computers. a common Network used by many corporations and universities is a land, or local area network. a typical land connects several computers that are geographically close to one another, often in the same building, and allows them to share resources, such as a printer, A database, or a file system. in a land, most user computers are called clients, and one or more computers act as servers. the server controls access to resources on the network and can supply services to the clients, such as answering database requests, storing and serving files, or managing email. the computers on the network can exchange data through physical cables or through a wireless network.</p>

        <h3>The Internet</h3>
          <p>the internet is a network of networks, connecting millions of computers around the world. the internet evolved from arpanet, a 1969 US military research project whose goal was to design a method for computers to communicate. most computers on the internet are clients, typically requesting resources, such as web pages, through an internet browser. these resources are provided by web servers, which store web pages and respond to these requests.</p>
          <p>every machine on the internet has a unique ID called its IP address bracket I pee stands for Internet protocol bracket. special computers called routers find a path through the internet from one computer to another using these IP addresses. a computer can have a static IP address, which is dedicated to that machine, or a dynamic IP address, which is assigned to the computer when it connects to the internet. an IP address is made up of four or sets, whose values and decimal notation or between 0 and 255. for instance, 58. 203. 151. 103 could represent such an IP address. in binary notation, this IP address is 111010. 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1. 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1. 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1. leader in this chapter, we will learn how to convert a decimal number such as 103, chew its binary equivalent, 1 1 0 0 1 1 1.</p>
