          <h4>1.1.2 Operating Systems</h4>
          <p>Operating System (OS) is a software program that:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>controls peripheral devices (like manages the file system)</li>
                <li>supports multitasking, by scheduling multiple programs or tasks to execute during the same interval</li>
                <li>allocates memory to each program, so that there is no conflict among the memory of any programs running at the same time</li>
                <li>prevents the user from damaging the system. for instance, it prevents user programs from overwriting the operating system or another program's memory</li>
            </ul>
          <p>The OS loads, or boots, when the computer system is turned on and is intended to run as long as the computer is running.</p>
          <p>Some OSs you may encounter:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
                <li>Android (mobile)</li>
                <li>Linux</li>
                <li>macOS</li>
                <li>iOS (mobile)</li>
            </ul>
