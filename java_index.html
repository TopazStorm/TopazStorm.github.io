  <h4>Hardware;</h4>
  <p>A computer typically contains the following components:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A CPU, Central Processing Unit, which executes the instructions of a program</li>
    <li>A Memory Unit, which holds the instructions and data of a program while it's executing</li>
    <li>A Hard Disk, to store programs and data so they can be loaded into memory, and accessed by the CPU</li>
    <li>A Keyboard, input of data</li>
    <li>A Monitor, display output from a program</li>
    <li>An Ethernet Port, wireless networking transceiver for connecting to the internet or LAN (Local Area Network)</li>
    <li>Other Components, like video card, disc drive</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Example: Your at Future Shop and see a PC with the following specs;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3.4 GHz Intel Core i3.3240 processor</li>
    <li>Touch Screen</li>
    <li>3 MB of cache memory</li>
    <li>8 GB RAM (Random Access Memory)</li>
    <li>1 TB (Terabyte) hard disk</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Intel Core i3.3240 is the CPU. Other processors (CPU) in personal computers and servers include AMD Athlon, Oracle SPARC, and the IBM POWER processor.</p>
  <p>CPUs consist of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - also called an Integer Unit (IU), which performs basic integer arithmetic and logical operations: a Floating Point Unit (FPU), which performs floating-point arithmetic - a set of hardware registers for holding data and memory addresses and other supporting hardware, including a control unit to sequence the instructions. Each CPU comes with its own set of instructions, the operations it can perform. The instructions typically perform arithmetic and logic operations, move data from one location to another, and change the flow of the program (which is run next)</p>
  <p>A program consists of many instructions. The first step in executing a program is loading it into memory. Each instruction in the program is executed by using a Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle. The Program Counter keeps trackof the next instruction to be fetched. The CPU fetches the next instrction from memory and places it into the Instruction Register. The instruction is decoded (move, load, store, other?), then the instrction is executed.This Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle continus until the program ends</p>
  <p>The speed of a CPU is related to its clock cycle, typically rated in GHz (Gigahertz). This clock speed, measured in clock cycles per second, determines how fast a processor can perform operations such as fetching , decoding, and executing instructions. A CPU rated at 2.5 GHz executes 2.5 billion clock cycles a second. Current RISC processors feature pipelining, which allows the CPU to process several instructions at once, so while one instruction is executing, the processor can decode the next instructions and fetch the next instruction after that. This greatly improves performance of applications</p>
